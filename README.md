# Implementation of system that can classify the absence or presence of heart disease (binary classification)

This repository contains files on Heart disease prediction project. We are concentrating on Binary Classification. 

You may find detailed description about dataset here (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Heart%29)

We have Dataset folder which contains original and prepared dataset files. 

Apply following classification algorithms:
1. Logistic regression
2. SVM
3. Decision tree
4. Random forest
5. Knn 

to evaluate the algorithms using the following metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 score

What is more, we tried to conduct the same classification task mentioned above but after we did preprocessing 
for data using PCA and compared the results (classification with PCA vs. classification without PCA)

We could get about 90% of each above mentioned metrics on TEST SET. However, you can get more if you do more finetunning. 

Have fun!
